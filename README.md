# The Chinese Graves Project

[![](https://api.travis-ci.org/sul-cidr/graves.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/sul-cidr/graves)

> The Chinese Graves Project is a digital humanities initiative based at Stanford that will build and harness an interactive spatial and textual analysis platform to examine the phenomenon of grave relocation in modern China, a campaign that has led to the exhumation and reburial of 10 million corpses in the past decade alone, and has transformed Chinaâ€™s graveyards into sites of acute personal, social, political, and economic contestation.

## Install for Development
Clone the repository.

Install postgreSQL and postGIS:

`brew install postgresql`

`brew install postgis` (on Mac)

Run postgreSQL at port 5432:

`brew services start postgresql`

Run `bundle`.

Initialise the graves databases with correct environment: 

`bundle exec rake db:setup`

`bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development`

You may need to clone the private graves-data repository and symlink it. You may need to use git-lfs to obtain the large binaries.

`brew install git-lfs`

From inside the graves-data repository, perform `git-lfs pull`. Then, from inside graves itself, symlink out with the equivalent of `ln -s ../graves-data data`, assuming graves-data is cloned into the same parent directory as graves.

With the new data, re-run the database migrations under the test environment to generate fixtures:

`bundle exec rake db:setup`

`bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test`

Run the tests once to complete the generation:

`bundle exec rake`

Before installing javascript dependencies, adjust your nodejs and npm versions to match the requirements of the current codebase's dependencies. Graves uses node v0.10.36 and npm 3.7.5.

To do this, use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) to set the node version:

`nvm install v0.10.36`, `nvm use v0.10.36`.

Then: 

`npm install -g npm@3.7.5`.

Now, run `npm install` to retrieve javascript dependencies.

Finally, manually restore the backup data into the postgres database by running:

`psql -d graves_development < graves-2-28-18.sql` inside `graves-data/backups` (in the graves-data repository). This will fully populate the database.

Once this completes, `rails s` and `grunt` to start the development server with compiled CSS and JS bundles and run the backend application.

You can now see graves running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment
Deployment for graves is done using capistrano. 

```sh
# An example (replace `prod` with a different deploy configuration if necessary)
$ bundle exec cap prod deploy
```

The deployment task does call a local `grunt compile:min` and uses capistrano to upload these to the deployed machine. To run this, make sure that you have installed the JavaScript dependencies.
